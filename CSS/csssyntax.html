        CSS syntax is a set of rules for writing CSS code. It defines how to write selectors, properties, and values to style HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector specifies which HTML elements the rule applies to, while the declaration block contains one or more declarations that define the styles to be applied.      
    </p>
    <p>
        Each declaration consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon. Multiple declarations are separated by semicolons. The declaration block is enclosed in curly braces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an example of a CSS rule:
        <pre>
            selector {
                property: value;
                property: value;
            }
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this example, "selector" is the selector, and the declarations inside the curly braces define the styles to be applied to the selected elements.


    </p>

        CSS syntax also includes comments, which are ignored by the browser and can be used to add notes or explanations to the code. Comments are enclosed in /* and */.
